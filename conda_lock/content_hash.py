"""Compute the content hash of a lock specification.

The content hash is used with `conda-lock --check-content-hash` to avoid unnecessary
relocking when the lock specification is unchanged.

Note that the content hash depends not only on the LockSpecification object but
also the virtual package specification.

WARNING: The fundamental concept of a content hash is seriously flawed:
<https://github.com/conda/conda-lock/issues/432#issuecomment-1637071282>

It is important to maintain the content hash for backwards compatibility,
but we should stop using it in the future.

Note that anything that modifies the content hash is a breaking change,
since it will invalidate all existing lockspecs.

The content hash is computed by JSON-serializing the lock specification and
the virtual package specification, and then hashing the serialized
representation.
