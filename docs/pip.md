# pip support

conda-lock has experimental support to allow locking mixed conda/pip environments.

## Usage with environment.yaml

`conda-lock` can lock the `dependencies.pip` section of
[environment.yml](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually), using a vendored copy of [Poetry's](https://python-poetry.org) dependency solver.

```{.yaml title="environment.yml"}
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python >=3.9
  - requests
  - pip:
    - some_pip_only_library
```

If in this case `some_pip_only_library` depends on `requests` that dependency will be met by
conda and the version will be constrained to what the conda solver determines.

We recommend avoiding the `--kind=explicit` flag when there are `pip`
dependencies. Most tools (except for `conda-lock install`) do not recognize
`pip` dependencies from explicit lockfiles, so they may be silently ignored.
The default lockfile format explicitly supports pip dependencies.

## Usage with pyproject.toml

If a dependency refers directly to a URL rather than a package name and version,
`conda-lock` will assume it is pip-installable, e.g.:

```{.toml title="pyproject.toml"}
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "3.9"
pymage = {url = "https://github.com/MickaelRigault/pymage/archive/v1.0.tar.gz#sha256=11e99c4ea06b76ca7fb5b42d1d35d64139a4fa6f7f163a2f0f9cc3ea0b3c55eb"}
```

Similarly, if a dependency is explicitly marked with `source = "pypi"`, it will
be treated as a `pip` dependency, e.g.:

```{.toml title="pyproject.toml"}
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "3.9"
ampel-ztf = {version = "^0.8.0-alpha.2", source = "pypi"}
```

In both these cases, the dependencies of `pip`-installable packages will also be
installed with `pip`, unless they were already requested by a `conda`
dependency.
